# May I introduce you...
*...to my favourite programming language?*

every once in a while you want to introduce someone new to the tidyverse. But how do you do it and where do you start?

(you have the chance to make the first impression.)

- setting: at work
- show that R can produce awesome results easily (get to the quirks later...)
- show where to learn more (cheatsheets)


- look for some of the cool resources to learn R

## some helpful resources
Here are some resources I've found:

## PS
Thank you, R.Ô∏è
